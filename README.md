# Discrete-Fracture-Network
Will make a proper documentation sooner or later. For now, just run the code by running the "main" files, of course you'll be downloading all the other dependencies as well. Numpy, scipy, plotly and dill must be preinstalled already in your machine in order to run this code.
# Dependencies
pip install plotly\
pip install scipy\
pip install numpy\
pip install dill
## or just install all of them this way
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run either main.py, main1.py or main2.py
Just run those scripts, and 6 files will be created:\
2 visualizations in .html format\
4 .txt files containing the datas about the mutual intersections
