# Discrete-Fracture-Network
Will make a proper documentation sooner or later. For now, just run the code by running the "main" file, of course you'll be importing all the other scripts as well. Numpy, Scipy, plotly, Dill and matplotlib must be preinstalled already in your machine in order to run this code. Thanks.
# Dependencies:
pip install plotly\
pip install scipy\
pip install numpy\
pip install dill
## or:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# See main.py, main1.py and main2.py for how to use it
