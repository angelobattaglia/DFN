# Discrete-Fracture-Network
Will make a proper documentation sooner or later. For now, just run the code by running the "main" file, of course you'll be importing all the other scripts as well. Numpy, Scipy, plotly, Dill and matplotlib must be preinstalled already in your machine in order to run this code. Thanks.
# Install the dependencies
pip install plotly
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install dill
