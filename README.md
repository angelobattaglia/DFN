# Discrete-Fracture-Network
Will make a proper documentation sooner or later. For now, just run the code by running the "main" file, of course importing all the other scripts as well. Numpy, Scipy, plotly, Dill and matplotlib must be preinstalled in your machine already in order to run this code. Thanks.
